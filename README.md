# Space X - SDL 2 Game
 
## Description
**Space X** is an engaging and strategic game developed using the SDL 2 library, where players are tasked with connecting points on a matrix by drawing lines. Each point in the matrix has a specific number of connections it requires, and players must strategically connect these points to fulfill the connection requirements.

## Key Features
- **Matrix-Based Gameplay**: Navigate through a grid-like matrix, where each point has its own connection needs (e.g., a point with four connections requires four lines to be drawn to it).
  
- **Single Player vs. AI**: Compete against an AI that autonomously plays, providing a challenging experience as players attempt to outsmart the computer's strategy.
  
- **Dynamic Line Drawing**: Players can draw lines to connect points, requiring strategic thinking to fulfill connection requirements while optimizing their moves.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive controls and a clear visual layout enhance user experience, making it easy to understand the game mechanics.
  
- **Challenge Mode**: Take on increasingly difficult levels where the complexity of the matrix and connection requirements ramp up, ensuring engaging gameplay for all skill levels.
